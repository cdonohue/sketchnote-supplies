# Supplies for effective sketchnoting
> I needed a place to gather my thoughts on creating sketchnotes and to keep a list of links for the supplies that I like.

#### Pens
[Sakura Micron .45mm black marker](http://amzn.com/B007OQ2RPE)
- soft tip, so it doesn't dig through paper like a ballpoint
- useful for both writing _and_ sketching

#### Notebooks
[Moleskine XL](http://amzn.com/8883707265)
