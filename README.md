# Supplies for effective sketchnoting
> I needed a place to gather my thoughts on creating sketchnotes and to keep a list of links for the supplies that I like.

#### Pens
[Sakura Micron .45mm black](http://amzn.com/B007OQ2RPE)
> This is the pen I use about 95% of the time. It has a soft tip, so it doesn't dig through paper like a ballpoint and it's useful for both writing _and_ sketching
