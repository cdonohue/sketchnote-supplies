# Supplies for effective sketchnoting
> I needed a place to gather my thoughts on creating sketchnotes and to keep a list of links for the supplies that I like.

#### Pens

Sakura Micron
- [.45mm black](http://amzn.com/B007OQ2RPE)
  - This is the pen I use about 95% of the time. It has a soft tip, so it doesn't dig through paper like a ballpoint and it's useful for both writing _and_ sketching
- [.35mm red](http://amzn.com/B0019CZZBW) `annotations`
- [1mm black](http://amzn.com/B0026HL23Y) `bolder lines`

Tombow Dual Tip
- [Cool Grey N95](http://amzn.com/B000KNQ0NS) `light shadows`
- [Cool Grey N65](http://amzn.com/B000KNJUOY) `dark shadows`
- [Chinese Red 856](http://amzn.com/B000XAORFQ) `bigger annotations`
- [Baby Yellow 090](http://amzn.com/B000KNJUBW) `highlights and emphasis`
